# Photomosaic Project (WIP)

### Overview

This is a photomosaic project I made for fun.

It converts an image into a photomosaic image, and it can resize
and crop the source images that you want to use as the 
images that will create the mosaic.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Pillow - The photo image library used for this project
- Pycharm - IDE

## How to use

- Clone the repository
- Change the filename of the photo you will be converting into a photomosaic in main.py
- Put the images you want to use to create the mosaic in an "images" file folder
- Run main.py
