# Photomosaic Project (WIP)

### Overview

This is a photomosaic project I made for fun.

It converts an image into a photomosaic image, and it can resize
and crop the source images that you want to use as the 
images that will create the mosaic.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Pillow - The photo image library used for this project
- Pycharm - IDE

## How to run it (on Windows)

- Clone the repository
- Create virtual environment

```
$ python -m venv env
```

- Activate virtual environment

```
$ .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

- Install requirements.txt

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Change the filename of the photo you will be converting into a photomosaic in main.py
- Create an "images" folder in the main directory
- Put the images you want to use to create the mosaic in the "images" file folder
- Run main.py
